### What I learned

Table Formatting: Gained experience with styling tables, including working with table headers, data cells, and managing borders and spacing.
CSS Units: Experimented with units like rem and px, though I struggled with making the layout responsive. Learning to use media queries and responsive design techniques is an area for future improvement.
